# Growing WildGrass - [no releases yet](https://github.com/averyc1876/GrowingWildGrass/releases)

This is a small mod for Vintage Story to patch Art of Growing functionality into Wild Grass.  
It means that grass from the Wild Grass mod will become a mowed grass block when cut, and function the same way as normal mown grass does in Art of Growing.

## Planned future features
- Integration with Art of Growing's dry grass system, so that wild grasses will cycle between growing and dry states
