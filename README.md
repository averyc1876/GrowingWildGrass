# Growing WildGrass - [main release](https://github.com/averyc1876/GrowingWildGrass/releases/tag/main-release) | [unofficial patch release](https://github.com/averyc1876/GrowingWildGrass/releases/tag/patch-release)

This is a small mod for Vintage Story to patch Art of Growing functionality into Wild Grass.  
It means that grass from the Wild Grass mod will become a mowed grass block when cut, and function the same way as normal mown grass does in Art of Growing.

## Planned future features
- Integration with Art of Growing's dry grass system, so that wild grasses will cycle between growing and dry states

## Versions  
When using this mod with the [Unofficial] Art of Growing patch, make sure to download the unofficial patch release not the main one.
